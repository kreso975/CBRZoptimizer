gcc window.c -o SimpleGUI.exe -mwindows -lMsimg32

-lMsimg32 is needed for image transparency

Firs we need to precompile .rs
windres app_icon.rc -O coff -o app_icon.res

And noww new compiler CMD is:
gcc window.c app_icon.res -o SimpleGUI.exe -mwindows -lmsimg32


main.c is CMD version but not finished





Created Makefile that compiles Windows version, run it in Terminal :
mingw32-make

hi, today we are going to continue working on my pure C Window app for windows CBR and CBZ optimizer and converter.
File structure windows.c holds all GUI logic, function.h function.c hold all functions regarding rar yip image optimization 
and some functions that GUI relies on. then resource.h, resources.rc , app loads config.ini as settings how to use functionalities. 
We are using miniz built in C for work wit zip, it can also be set to use external app like 7zip. For rar external Unrar or winrar. 
Image optimiyitaion internaly when external is not set we use STB libraries. Exernal if set is ImageMagick.


app now has: Config-driven flexibility
             Cross-tool consistency (ImageMagick + STB)
             Clear separation of UI/data logic
             Upscale/aspect logic that behaves intelligently
             And debug logging that leaves no mystery behind

A couple little niceties to consider before going public:

🧼 INI schema validation or auto-repair (e.g., warning on bad entries)
🕹️ Tray icon or system integration (if it's long-running)
📖 README with screenshots, setup guide, and sample config.ini
✅ Presets or profile support: maybe a couple example config bundles?
